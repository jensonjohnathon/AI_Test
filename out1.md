1. **Identify and Transcribe Main Content Area:** The document contains two tables and a caption. The main content is clearly defined by the margins. I will transcribe all text, including headers, footers (if any), and captions.

2. **Process Table 1:**

   - **Determine Columns:** The table has a complex header structure with multiple levels. The top row has "OOD Dataset" spanning two columns, "INaturalist", "SUN", "Places", "Textures", "Ninco", "SSB Hand", and "Average". Each of these then spans "AUROC" and "FPR". The last column is "AUROC".
   - **Handle Multi-level Headers:** Markdown tables do not directly support multi-level headers. I will flatten the header by concatenating the parent and child headers, e.g., "OOD Dataset AUROC", "OOD Dataset FPR", etc. This ensures all information is present in a single row.
   - **Extract Data:** Transcribe all numerical data and row labels accurately.
   - **Construct Markdown Table:** Use `|` for columns and `---` for the header separator. Align columns as they appear visually (left-aligned for text, right-aligned for numbers).

3. **Process Table 2:**

   - **Determine Columns:** This table has a simpler header structure with "Index", "Order", and then a series of numerical columns from 1 to 19.
   - **Extract Data:** Transcribe all text and numerical data.
   - **Construct Markdown Table:** Use `|` for columns and `---` for the header separator. Align columns as they appear visually (left-aligned for text, right-aligned for numbers).

4. **Transcribe Caption:** The caption "Table 3. Order of ImageNet-C perturbations in the experiments." is located below Table 2. I will transcribe it as a regular paragraph following the table.

5. **Final Review:** Check for any missed text, incorrect formatting, or errors in transcription. Ensure all elements (tables, caption) are present and correctly ordered. The document is simple, so no images or complex math are involved.
